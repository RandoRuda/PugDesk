With nothing but their wits, will, and fists, pugilists lay it all on the table every time they’re in for a scrap. No strangers to adversity, pugilists can dish it out, take a licking and still keep coming back for more. A pugilist’s unbreakable spirit and talent for fisticuffs don’t come from rigorous training or high minded philosophies but are the hard won trophies of never backing down from a fight no matter the odds.

All pugilists belong to a Fight Club, an informal fraternity of brawlers with similar style, that shapes the way they fight. Fight Clubs included in the release version  are: Arena Royale, Bloodhound Bruisers, Piss & Vinegar, the Squared Circle, and the Sweet Science. Whether you’re interested in playing an adventuring luchador, a boxer fighting the  good fight, or a hard-nosed detective with a penchant for pugilism,  these Fight Clubs have you covered!

Fight Club (Subclass):
Despite the name, fight clubs are not formal  fraternities or sororities, but collections of pugilists who, by  training or happenstance , share a similar style.

[size=4]Arena Royale:[/size]
 Pugilists in the Arena Royale fight club earn their keep as  equal parts performer and gladiator. Whether performing in a show or fighting it out after, pugilists in the Arena Royale care as much about the theatrics of a fight as they do its outcome.
